### Example:

Situation

> I was managing a project for XX company.
  The company wanted to release the product by the end of the financial year,
  so we had very tight deadlines. 
  One of the programmers on our team missed several deadlines. 
  When I approached him about it, he got very angry and confrontational. 

Action 

> I was taken aback by his angry response, but I tried to remain calm.
  I acknowledged that the deadline was tight and that he was working hard. 
  I also offered to help and identify what was causing the delays. 

Result

> He calmed down a bit when he saw that I wasnâ€™t attacking him.
  We talked about his progress and managed to identify the key reasons for the delay.
  We then worked out the solution together. Even though that situation was a bit unpleasant,
  I think I learnt from it as it reminded me of the importance of staying calm and positive.
